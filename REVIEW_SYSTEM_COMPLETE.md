# 🌟 Orbit Trails Review System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented a complete customer review system for your Orbit Trails website. Here's what has been created:

### 🗄️ Backend Implementation
- **Database Model** (`server/models/Review.ts`): MongoDB schema with approval workflow
- **API Controller** (`server/controllers/reviewController.ts`): Business logic with validation
- **Routes** (`server/routes/reviews.ts`): RESTful endpoints with authentication
- **Integration** (`server/index.ts`): Routes properly configured in main server

### 🎨 Frontend Implementation
- **Review Submission Page** (`client/pages/ReviewUs.tsx`): Customer form with star rating
- **Customer Reviews Page** (`client/pages/CustomerReviews.tsx`): Public display of approved reviews
- **Admin Panel Integration** (`client/pages/Admin.tsx`): Review management with approve/reject
- **Homepage Integration** (`client/pages/Index.tsx`): Random reviews in testimonials section
- **Footer Navigation** (`client/components/Footer.tsx`): "Review Us" link added

### 🔗 API Endpoints
```
POST   /api/reviews              - Submit new review
GET    /api/reviews              - Get all approved reviews  
GET    /api/reviews/random       - Get random approved reviews
PATCH  /api/reviews/:id/status   - Update review status (admin)
