## GitHub Actions Integration

Create `.github/workflows/sonar-analysis.yml`:

```yaml
name: SonarCloud Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  sonarcloud:
    name: SonarCloud Analysis
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0  # Shallow clones should be disabled for better analysis
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '20'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: npm run test:coverage
    
    - name: SonarCloud Scan
      uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
```

## What SonarQube Will Analyze in Your Project

### Frontend (React/TypeScript):
- **Security Issues**: XSS vulnerabilities, unsafe DOM manipulation
- **Code Quality**: Complex components, duplicate code
- **Best Practices**: React hooks usage, TypeScript type safety
- **Performance**: Unnecessary re-renders, large bundle sizes

### Backend (Node.js/Express):
- **Security Issues**: SQL injection, authentication flaws
- **Code Quality**: Complex functions, error handling
- **Best Practices**: Async/await usage, proper error handling
- **API Security**: Input validation, CORS configuration

### Sample Issues SonarQube Might Find:

1. **Security Hotspot**: Hardcoded credentials
2. **Bug**: Potential null pointer exceptions
3. **Code Smell**: Functions with too many parameters
4. **Vulnerability**: Missing input validation
5. **Duplication**: Repeated code blocks

## Local Analysis Setup

Add to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "sonar": "sonar-scanner",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
    "lint:sonar": "eslint . --format json --output-file eslint-report.json"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "sonar-scanner": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Quality Gates

Set up quality gates to ensure:
- ✅ Code coverage > 80%
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Technical debt ratio < 5%
- ✅ Duplicated lines < 3%
- ✅ Maintainability rating A

## Reports You'll Get

### Dashboard Metrics:
- **Reliability**: Bug count and reliability rating
- **Security**: Vulnerability count and security rating  
- **Maintainability**: Code smells and maintainability rating
- **Coverage**: Test coverage percentage
- **Duplication**: Duplicated code percentage
- **Size**: Lines of code, files, functions

### Detailed Reports:
- **Issues List**: All bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells
- **Security Hotspots**: Potential security risks to review
- **Code Coverage**: Line-by-line coverage report
- **Duplications**: Duplicate code blocks identification

## Best Practices for Your Team

1. **Fix Security Issues First** - Address vulnerabilities immediately
2. **Maintain Coverage** - Keep test coverage above 80%
3. **Review New Issues** - Check SonarQube reports for new code
4. **Set Quality Gates** - Don't merge code that fails quality checks
5. **Regular Reviews** - Weekly team reviews of code quality metrics

## Cost Considerations

### SonarCloud:
- **Free**: Public repositories
- **Paid**: Private repositories ($10/month for small teams)

### Self-Hosted:
- **Free**: Community Edition (good for your needs)
- **Paid**: Developer/Enterprise editions (more features)
